# Random Quote Machine

This repo is for the 'Random Quote Machine' exercise from the Front End Development Libraries Projects on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

You can view this project on my github pages: https://duncan-s-white.github.io/random-quote-machine/

This was my first ever react project, it is written from scratch, adding react with a `<script>` tag not using the `create-react-app` command. 

It uses:

 - Bootstrap CSS framework for styling.
 - Class components.
 - Redux. The tutorials on Freecodecamp for react are paired with redux and therefore, although not necessary, this was the pattern I was familiar with.

# Random Quote Machine

This 'Random Quote Machine' project is from the Front End Development Libraries Projects on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

You can view this project on my GitHub pages: https://duncan-s-white.github.io/random-quote-machine/

This was my first ever [React](https://reactjs.org/) project. It is written from scratch, and includes React and other dependencies with a `<script>` tag, not using the `create-react-app` command. 

It uses:

 - Bootstrap CSS framework for styling.
 - Class components.
 - Redux. The tutorials on Freecodecamp for React are paired with Redux and therefore, although not necessary, this was the pattern I was familiar with.
